Intelligent Machines: AI

Perspectives on AI: behaving and thinking logically and humanely

Background of AI

Philosophy, economics, psychology, sociology, linguistics, neuroscience, mathematics, computer science, and control theory are the bases of artificial intelligence.

AI applications

The capacity to think, comprehend, create, understand, learn from experience, and plan and carry out difficult tasks are all examples of intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence: The term artificial intellect (AI) describes the emulation of human intelligence in devices that have been designed to behave and think like humans. The phrase may also be used to refer to any computer that demonstrates characteristics of the human intellect, such learning and problem-solving.

Perspectives on AI

Acting and Thinking Humanly: "The study of how to make a computer perform things at the moment that humans are better at." Acting Humanly: (1991; Rich and Knight) The Turing Test Approach is another name for acting in a human manner. The Turing test was developed to show whether a certain computer can think or not. It was first suggested by Alan Turing in 1950. He proposed a test based on the capacity to be mistaken for humans, which are unquestionably clever. During the test, an interrogator converses with both a person and a computer. The interrogator must determine which of the two is a person within a certain amount of time and which is a machine.
If a human interrogator can't determine if a written answer is from a person after presenting certain written questions, the machine passes the test. A computer has to be able to do the following in order to pass the Turing test: Knowledge representation: To keep track of what it knows and hears. Natural language processing: Must be able to converse effectively in English. Automated reasoning: Respond to the inquiries using the data that has been saved. Machine learning: Must be flexible enough to adjust to changing conditions.

The Turing test avoids direct contact with a human interrogator. It is not required to simulate humans physically to measure IQ

The interrogator may assess the subject's object manipulation and perceptual skills by using video signals and manipulation capacity as part of the full Turing test. A computer must possess the following extra skills in order to pass the full Turing test: Computer Vision: Object perception Robotics: The ability to move and control items

"The intriguing new attempt to make computers think," according to Thinking Humanly, "machines with brains in the complete and literal sense." (1985; Haugeland) Another name for Thinking Humanly is "Cognitive Modeling Approach." The term cognition refers to the process or activity of learning via experience, thinking, and the senses. Scientific ideas on the inner workings of the brain (cognitive model) are needed to create machines that think like human brains. There are two methods to do this: - by introspection, which involves seeing our thoughts as they occur - and - through psychological tests. Once we have a definite theory of mind, we may write a computer programme to represent the theory. The goal of cognitive science is to develop accurate and verifiable ideas of how the human mind functions. It combines computer models from artificial intelligence with experimental methods from psychology.

Thinking and acting logically: "Computational intelligence is the study of the construction of intelligent beings," says acting logically. (Poole and others, 1998) The Rational Agent Approach is another name for acting rationally. Something that acts is an agent. The following qualities are anticipated in computer agents:
possessing autonomy, awareness of their surroundings, endurance over an extended length of time, the capacity to adapt to change, and the capacity to assume the objectives of others. Being rational entails acting morally. According to the knowledge at hand, the proper action is one which is anticipated to optimise goal attainment. A rational agent behaves in a way that will produce the best result or, in the case of uncertainty, the best predicted result. The focus in this strategy is on drawing the right conclusions. To reach a conclusion logically and take action based on that conclusion is one example of rational behaviour. On the other hand, certain reasonable behaviours may be described as not involving inference. As an example, turning away from a host stove is a reflex response that is often more effective than a slower one carried out after careful thought. Advantages include being more universal than rules of thinking methods and being more open to scientific growth than approaches based on human behaviour or human cognition due to the criterion of rationality being clearly defined and entirely generic.

The study of the calculations that enable perception, reasoning, and action is referred to as "thinking rationally." (1992 Winston) The Laws of Thought Approach is another name for "Thinking Rationally." One of the earliest thinkers to try to codify sound reasoning and proper thinking was Aristotle. He provided syllogisms that, when given the right premises, always produced the right conclusion. For instance:

Man named Ram

Being mortal, man

Ram is human.

Let p(x) == man and x be If the above sentence may be expressed as p(x) => q if q(x) => x is mortal (x) Ram is man, and man is mortal. Q(x) is also true from a modus ponens perspective. Ram is a mortal, therefore.

Problems: When information is not completely definite, it might be difficult to translate informal knowledge into the formal words needed by logical notation.

Principles-based issue solving differs from practical problem solving. Any computer may run out of computing power when faced with issues involving a large number of facts unless it is given instructions on which step in the reasoning process to attempt first.

The first artificial boolean neurones were created in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts to do calculations.

first steps towards connectionist learning and computation (Hebbian learning). The first neural network computer was built by Marvin Minsky and Dann Edmonds in 1951. In 1950, Alan Turing published "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," which was the first comprehensive vision of AI.

The advent of AI (1956)

Leading experts in automata theory, neural networks, and the study of intelligence will be gathered at the Dartmouth Workshop. - Allen Newell and Herbert Simon's The Logic Theorist, the first software to employ non-numerical reasoning to prove theorems. These players dominated the field for the next 20 years. Research into AI has failed (1966 - 1973) Progress was less rapid than anticipated. - Unfounded forecasts. - Some systems were not scalable. - Explosive combinatorial search. - Basic restrictions on methods and representations. - Perceptrons by Minsky and Papert (1969).

Knowledge-based systems helped AI resurge in the years between 1969 and 1970.

Consider the DENDRAL project (Buchanan et al. 1969) initial, effective knowledge-intensive system. - The use of MYCIN expert systems to identify blood infections (Feigenbaum et al.) Increase in knowledge representation research; introduction of uncertainty in reasoning. Frames, semantic networks, logic, etc. AI becomes a business (1980 - present) R1 at December (McDermott, 1982) The United States' reaction to the Fifth Generation Project in Japan (1981) ends the AI winter.

The connectionist resurgence (1986–present) includes backprop, parallel distributed processing, and the return of the neural network (RumelHart and McClelland, 1986).

AI develops into a science (1987 - present) Hidden markov models are used for voice recognition, neural networks are used for uncertain reasoning, and Bayesian network formalism is used for expert systems.

The development of intelligent agents since 1995 - "How does an agent act/behave immersed in actual surroundings with continuous sensory inputs?" is the central question in the field of agents.

AI's philosophical underpinnings include logic, rationality, the mind as a physical system, the basis of learning, language, and rationality.

From whence does knowledge originate? How can information inspire action? How does the mental self develop from the bodily self? Can legitimate conclusions be reached using formal rules? Algorithms for formal representation and proof, computation, intractability, and undecidability are all covered in mathematics.

What are the official guidelines for arriving at reliable judgments? What is calculable? How do we make decisions based on ambiguous data? Psychology: Motor control, perceptual phenomena, and adaptation.

human and animal thought and behaviour? Economics: Game theory, operation research, and formal theory of rational decision-making.

How should we decide in order to maximise reward? How should we proceed when others may not agree? How should we proceed when the reward might be years away? Linguistics: Grammar and knowledge representation

How are language and mind related? Neuroscience: The physical basis of mental processes

How do brains interpret data? Homeostatic systems, stability, and ideal agent design in control theory

How are artefacts able to function independently? either computer science or computer engineering Operational programmable computer and operational computer

How can we create a computer that is effective? Time sharing, interactive interpreters, personal computers with windows and mice, rapid development environments, the linked list data type, automatic storage management, and fundamental ideas of symbolic, functional, declarative, and object-oriented programming are just a few of the innovations that AI has pioneered that have found their way back into mainstream computer science.

Applications of AI: AI has dominated a number of industries, including

In strategic games like chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where machines can conceive of a vast number of probable positions based on heuristic knowledge, AI plays a key role.

Interacting with a machine that comprehends human-spoken natural language is feasible thanks to natural language processing.

Expert Systems: A few applications combine hardware, software, and specialised knowledge to transmit reasoning and advice. They provide users explanations and recommendations.

Systems for understanding, interpreting, and comprehending visual information on a computer are known as vision systems. For instance,

A spying aircraft collects pictures that are used to create a map or spatial database of the region.

Clinical expert systems are used by doctors to diagnose patients.

Police utilise computer software that can identify a criminal's face from a saved forensic artist-created portrait.

Speech Recognition When a person speaks to an intelligent system, some of them are able to hear what they are saying and understand the phrases and their meanings. It can manage a variety of dialects, slang, background noise, changes in human sounds brought on by the cold, etc.

Handwriting Recognition – Text written with a pen on paper or a stylus on a computer screen may be read by handwriting recognition software. It can convert it into editable text and identify the letter forms.

Intelligent robots are capable of carrying out the duties that humans assign them. They are equipped with sensors that can pick up on physical information from the outside environment, including light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bumps, and pressure. To demonstrate intelligence, they have powerful processors, many sensors, and a large amount of memory. Additionally, they have the capacity to grow from their errors and mould themselves to the new surroundings.
